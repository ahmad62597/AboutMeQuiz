This program should be executable on Visual Studio Community version as is. The nature of the program is a guessing game 
in which the user tries to answer 5 questions about the creater of the program (me). If answered correctly, the app will
record the answer, and at the end of all 5 questions the app will display the results out of 5. If the user gets an answer
correct, the program will let the user know, and if they get the answer wrong, the app will also let the user know. I didn't 
know how to attach the picture to the README file, so I uploaded it as a seperate file of my app running on github. Sorry about 
that.
